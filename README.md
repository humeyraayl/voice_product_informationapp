# voice_product_informationapp
The project is an artificial intelligence supported product information program.
It was created in C# language.
Using the Speechlib.h library, product information is recorded in the database with sound.
Adding and deleting operations are performed with voice commands.




I have done this project within the scope of object-oriented software course.
